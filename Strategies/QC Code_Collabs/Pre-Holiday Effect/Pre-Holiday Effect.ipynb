Research shows that market return during pre-holiday days is often more than ten times larger than the average return during normal trading days. It seems that a substantial part of the equity premium is concentrated in these several days.\n","\n","This anomaly has been documented in many countries, so its validity seems really strong. Pre-holiday days on the market are often characterized by lower liquidity as a lot of market participants are not involved in the market, or they lower their exposure. A higher probability of positive market movement is consequently only a natural tendency as people are psychologically more optimistic. Therefore a very simple strategy could be constructed to exploit this market in-efficiency.\n","\n","https://quantpedia.com/strategies/pre-holiday-effect/\n","\n","Fundamental reason\n","\n","The main explanatory factors for this anomaly are behavioral. One explanation states that short-sellers close their risky positions prior to holidays. Another reason could be investors’ good mood around holidays, indicating greater optimism about future prospects and, therefore, a high probability of positive market moves.\n","\n","https://www.quantconnect.com/tutorials/strategy-library/pre-holiday-effect"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ut6SCqsOgWHp"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","from datetime import timedelta\n","\n","class PreHolidayEffectAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):\n","\n","    def Initialize(self):\n","\n","        self.SetStartDate(2000, 1, 1)  \n","        self.SetEndDate(2021, 1, 1)    \n","        self.SetCash(100000)           \n","        self.AddEquity(\"SPY\", Resolution.Daily)\n","\n","\n","    def OnData(self, data):\n","        calendar1 = self.TradingCalendar.GetDaysByType(TradingDayType.PublicHoliday, self.Time, self.Time+timedelta(days=2)) \n","        calendar2 = self.TradingCalendar.GetDaysByType(TradingDayType.Weekend, self.Time, self.Time+timedelta(days=2)) \n","        holidays = [i.Date for i in calendar1] \n","        weekends = [i.Date for i in calendar2]\n","        # subtract weekends in all holidays\n","        public_holidays = list(set(holidays) - set(weekends))\n","\n","        if not self.Portfolio.Invested and len(public_holidays)>0:\n","            self.SetHoldings(\"SPY\", 1)\n","        elif self.Portfolio.Invested and len(public_holidays)==0:\n","            self.Liquidate()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CzparOnegbTE"},"source":[""]}]}
