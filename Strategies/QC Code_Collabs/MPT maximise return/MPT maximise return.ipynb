For the covariance matrix, we used the historical covariance matrix of returns for the trailing twelve months. \n","# As the mean-variance optimization seeks any optimal set of portfolio weights, There is the potential for the portfolio to become quite concentrated at times. To reduce this possibility, we imposed caps (max weights) on assets to enforce greater diversification as indicated in the paper. E.g. impose a cap of 25% for all risky assets and no cap (i.e. a cap of 100%) for all cash-like assets.\n","# Optimization\n","#  For optimization, maximizing the return given target volatility stays unchanged (We use 15% as the target volatility). \n","\n","\n","\n","class AssetAllocationAlgorithm(QCAlgorithm):\n","    \n","    # Risky -
